Summary: EZSMS was not sending SMS from 2022/06/09 18:40 - 2022/06/10 14:30 (JST)

Thank you for using [EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/).

As we have informed you via [twitter](https://twitter.com/xoxzocom/status/1535148766118150144), EZSMS had a service disruption from 2022/06/09 18:40 (JST) until 2022/06/10 14:30. During this time, the message delivery from _From WEB_ and _CSV Upload_ was delayed and the messages were sent after the system had recovered.

We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused.

The disruption was caused by a human error while working on a system update, not related to our SMS sending functionality. We reviewed the release flow to strictly prevent this from happenening again.

We will contact the affected users with the details.
