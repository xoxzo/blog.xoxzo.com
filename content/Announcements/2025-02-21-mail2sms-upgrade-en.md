Summary: With just a few presetting on the dashboard, convert email to SMS messages and send. Now this feature has an extra functionality!


Xoxzo, the telephony API platform, has released an additional feature called "System Feedback" for [Mail2SMS](https://help.xoxzo.com/en/xoxzo-cloud-telephony/sms-api/articles/how-to-send-via-mail2sms/), which allows you to send SMS messages directly from your email.

Changes from the existing Mail2SMS: </br>
* System Feedback: If processing fails, you will receive a notification email explaining the reason. </br>
* New recipient email address: Send your emails to mail2sms@xoxzo.com. </br>
* Specify the recipient's phone number in the subject line: Example: +818011111111</br>
