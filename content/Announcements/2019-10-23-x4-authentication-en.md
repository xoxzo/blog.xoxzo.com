Thank you for using [Xoxzo Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en).

Starting from October 23, 2019, in order to purchase credits, we require that you authenticate your mobile number. This will help us to make your account safer and make it more difficult for abusers to take advantage of the service. We will only use your mobile number for authentication purposes and to contact you in case of emergencies.
