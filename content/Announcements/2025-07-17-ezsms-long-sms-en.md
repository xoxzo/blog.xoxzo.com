Thank you as always for using [Xoxzo – the Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/).  
Following the [June update that enabled up to 660 characters for Xoxzo’s SMS sending API](https://blog.xoxzo.com/en/2025/06/03/long-sms/), our sister service [EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/) has now launched its own long message SMS feature.

SMS offers immediacy and requires only a recipient’s mobile phone number. With the rise of smartphone usage, it has also become a smooth pathway to drive traffic from text messages to web browsers.  
However, including long URLs—even when using a URL shortener—can still consume a fair number of characters. With the traditional 70-character limit, crafting an effective message has often been a real challenge.

This is especially true for marketing messages. Once you include promotional content, opt-out instructions, and maybe a short greeting, there’s hardly any space left.

EZSMS is a no-code, browser-based SMS service with a user-friendly interface. Now that it supports up to 660 characters per message, it has become even more useful—allowing you to tailor the length and content of your message to suit a wide range of marketing strategies.

Take full advantage of this new flexibility and bring your creative ideas to life.

We look forward to your continued support of both [EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/) and [Xoxzo](https://www.xoxzo.com/).
