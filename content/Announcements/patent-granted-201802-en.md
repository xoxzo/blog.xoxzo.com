it is a system to promote new technological development with hints as it publishes its invention instead.
Indeed, it can be said that the patent system is one of the pillars supporting Japan's economic growth.

This is utilized in various use cases such as notification call of authentication codes on a new account registration for 
safer use of web-services, reaching out to the phones by voice call that are not available to receive SMS notices 
and the conference calls to enable more than 2 parties to join a call, etc.
