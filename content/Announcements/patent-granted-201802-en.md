Patent Office has 
Patent system to protect technology
It is "intellectual property right" that protects ideas and inventions born by technology development as property, 
which is useful in the world.

While the patent system allows inventors to monopolize inventions, 
it is a system to promote new technological development with hints as it publishes its invention instead.
Indeed, it can be said that the patent system is one of the pillars supporting Japan's economic growth.

The technology that was granted this patent for is used in Xoxzo's [VOICE API](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/voice-api/).
This is utilized in various use cases such as notification call of authentication codes on a new account registration for 
safer use of web-services, reaching out to the phones by voice call that are not available to receive SMS notices 
and the [conference calls](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/privacy-call/) to enable more than 2 parties to join a call, etc.
We Xoxzo hope that our technology will help to built more online service security and to revitalize 
the current and the future application development.
