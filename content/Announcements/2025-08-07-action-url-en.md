Summary: Introducing Action URL: Easily configure how your Dial-In Numbers respond during active hours, inactive hours, or anonymous calls â€” all from your browser.


# New Feature: Action URL Now Available!

Weâ€™re excited to introduce a new feature for Xoxzo Dial-In Number (DIN) users:  
**Action URL** â€” a smarter, more flexible way to handle inbound call actions.

Until now, actions could only be set via API.  
With **Action URL**, you can now configure everything directly from your browser.
Even better, a single URL can handle **Active Hours**, **Inactive Hours**, and even **Anonymous Callers** â€” all in one.

## âœ… Highlights of Action URL

- **Browser-based configuration** â€” no programming needed  
- **Time-based control** â€” set different actions for business and off-hours  
- **Supports anonymous callers** â€” tailor actions for hidden numbers  
- **Up to two actions per URL** (API allows only one)

---

## ðŸ’¡ Use Case Examples

- Forward calls during working hours, play a TTS message after hours  
- Switch to voicemail on holidays  
- Play a message for anonymous callers before allowing or rejecting the call
