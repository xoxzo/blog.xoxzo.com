## 社会福祉事業者、公共サービス事業者の方々への感謝

Xoxzoでは、多くの人々が自宅待機の間でも、必要な公共のサービスの継続提供のためにたゆまず職務を続けている
看護婦の方々、教師、医者、介護者、管理者、清掃業者や店内在庫管理者など、
医療従事者や社会福祉事業の従事者、公共サービス事業の関係者の方々、
すべてのフロントラインで働く方々に、最高の感謝を伝えたいと思います。

普段はあって当然の用に感じていても、実際の生活の中でまさに社会の基礎を支えている方々であることを、
謙虚に認識いたします。


## 従業員、顧客、ベンダーの健康について

Xoxzoは、従業員、顧客、そしてベンダーの健康を最優先に考えています。

従業員は、2007年からリモートで作業しており、日々のスタッフ間の物理的な接触はありません。 
毎年開催のスプリングキャンプは、2020年3月に予定されていましたが、
必要な対面ミーティングはすべてオンラインセッションに移行としました。

また、すべての従業員に、現地の法律および現地当局からの指示を遵守し、ウイルスの拡散を阻止するよう指示しています。

Having said that, the mental health of our employees cannot be forgotten or even
understated. Working remotely puts a [unique mental stresses on remote workers]({filename}/The Way We Work/Pitfalls-Remote-Work-en.md),
and we have always put efforts to constantly monitor and alleviate this stress.
These efforts, of course, are continuous and did not start and will not stop with the COVID-19 crisis.

Due to our remote nature, we also have minimal physical contact with our
customers or vendors. All necessary meetings have all been rescheduled to be
done online.

## Our business, our community and our economy

Xoxzo Inc. and its sister companies have always been working remotely since
inception in 2007. In that sense, the current lockdown situation in nearly all the
cities our staff is currently in does not have much impact on our business
processes.

Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, we do not see any significant changes to
our business and operation metrics. We are available to our customers as per
normal.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for everyone around us. The Python
Software Foundation (PSF) which we rely on to safeguard and continue improving
the core technology that we use in our products are [being affected by the
outbreak in the United States](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2020/03/march-12-update-on-covid-19.html).
As a sign of support, we have committed to donating USD1,000 to the PSF in the
event that PyCon 2020 conference is canceled.

Not much but I hope it makes it easier for you folks. You folks have always helped us on this side of the world. <a href="https://t.co/txLy9yrBDw">https://t.co/txLy9yrBDw</a></p>&mdash; Iqbal Abdullah 🇯🇵 🇲🇾 🇪🇪 / Xoxzo Telephony (@iqbalabd) <a href="https://twitter.com/iqbalabd/status/1238477812077441024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We're encouraging our staff to make purchases from local businesses and actively
support the economy of the community they are in.

Other than business travel, we also do not have any plans to reduce our business
expenditure from what we have on the budget. We hope with these small actions of ours,
we will not contribute to any negative impact that our vendors and other parties
that we do business with are facing.

## Thank you to you

During this time of uncertainty, we want to acknowledge the incredible support we have received from you, our customers,
and the resilience that is shown by our staff.

We will continue to monitor the situation and will post notifications as the
need arises here on our blog and also on our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/xoxzocom). You can also reach
