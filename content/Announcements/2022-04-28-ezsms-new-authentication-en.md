Summary: From Thursday, April 28th, 2022  the authentication method for creating new accounts at EZSMS will be updated to enhance security.

Thank you for using [EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/)

EZSMS is a platform that allows you to send SMS messages from your PC, it's easy to use even if you are not a technical person. 

We always try to keep improving our services. 
Last time we released [the number formatter](https://blog.xoxzo.com/en/2022/03/15/number-formatter-release/): a tool that automatically changes phone numbers to the E.164 standard format so you don’t have to edit your number list manually.

This time we have implemented a new authentication system for the creation of new accounts. We find safety and security highly important, in addition this also made the signup process easier.

The new authentication system that introducing [GetOTP](https://otp.dev/en) will be effective from Tuesday the 28th of April 2022.

## What will change?
**1. When creating a new account, we will perform two types of authentication using the new system: one for email and one for your mobile phone number.**
- As of the 28th of April, users who have already created an account and authenticated with their mobile phone number will not be affected by this change.<br>
- If you have created an account but haven't authenticated your mobile phone number by the 28th of April, please contact the help desk (support@ezsms.biz). <br>

**2. When you change your registered e-mail address, the new e-mail address will be authenticated by the newly introduced external authentication system.**
