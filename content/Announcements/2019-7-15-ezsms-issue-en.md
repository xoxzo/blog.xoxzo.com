Summary: We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this issue

Thank you for using [Xoxzo, Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/).

As we notified [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/xoxzotelephony/status/1150653542501191680), 
our EZSMS Sending SMS was queued from 6.18PM (JST) on July 14 to 2.00PM (JST) on July 15, 2019.

During this time, the messages were sent from the web form but stayed in the queue until we restarted. 

The messages being sent during this period were all sent in order after 2.00PM (JST) on July 15.

The direct cause for this is still under investigation but we have applied the new watching mechanism of finding this kind of issue for the future issue prevention. 

We are deeply sorry for any inconvenience or loss caused by this issue, for any questions, please contact us at anytime.

Thank you for your continuous support from the team Xoxzo.
