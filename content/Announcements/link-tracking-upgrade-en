Summary: On November 6th, 2023 Xoxzo upgraded the link tracking functionality 
to be able to track multiple clicks, as requested by our users.

On November 6th, 2023 [Xoxzo](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/) upgraded the [link tracking functionality](https://blog.xoxzo.com/en/2020/10/15/link-tracking-release/) as requested by our users. 
Link tracking is an optional parameter that you can use for the Xoxzo SMS API to obtain data about SMS messages you’ve sent. 

Previously, link tracking could only detect the first time a user clicked a link in the SMS message.
Now it’s also possible to track when a user clicks a link several times and view the time stamp(s). 

With this information, it’s easier to understand which users are most interested in your campaign.
Please use this data to improve your next SMS campaign!
