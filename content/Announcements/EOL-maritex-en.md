Summary: Goodbye from MARITEX

In 2007, with the idea of making international SMS much more affordable and easy
to use, [MARITEX International SMS Service](http://www.maritex.jp/) was launched. 
From that time until now, MARITEX at it's peak has sent thousands of messages monthly, 
connecting family and friends in Japan and abroad.

When the iPhone was first released in Japan in 2008, that started the smartphone
revolution. With the smartphone, came all types of over the top (OTT) services
to send messages via applications, such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.
Person-to-person (P2P) communication via SMS has dwindled in the past few years
as the popularity of these OTT increased. The usage of so-called carrier emails
which is needed to register to MARITEX have also decreased in exchange for other
types of web based emails, showing the changing times.

Within this trend, the usage of MARITEX has also decreased. Currently only 2% of
the registered users of MARITEX are active users in some form or another.

Although perhaps less in the context of P2P, SMS as a whole is still very much
used worldwide. We are seeing huge increases for demand within our [EZSMS
Messaging Platform](https://www.ezsms.biz/ja/) and [Xoxzo Cloud Telephony
Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/) services, for businesses
and developers who want to communicate with their end customers and integrate
SMS and voice into their applications:

> The total number of SMS sent globally tripled between 2007 and 2010, from an
> estimated 1.8 trillion to a staggering 6.1 trillion. In other words, close to
> 200 000 text messages are sent every second. http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/
> After nearly 9 years, we believe that MARITEX has run it's course and it is time
> for us to move on an focus on what matters: The next generation of
> communication.
