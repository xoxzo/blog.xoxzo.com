# Account Security Enhancements – New Features Announcement

At Xoxzo, we are continuously working to improve the security of our platform  
to ensure our users can use our services with confidence.

As part of our ongoing security enhancements, we have introduced several new features and updates designed to better protect user accounts and prevent unauthorized access.

---

## Newly Added Security Features

### 1. Email Alerts for Login from a New IP Address
When a login is detected from an IP address that has not been used before,  
an **email notification** will be sent to the registered email address.

This allows users to quickly identify and respond to any suspicious login activity.

---

### 2. Account Lock After Consecutive Failed Login Attempts
If there are **three consecutive failed login attempts**,  
the account will be **automatically locked** for security reasons.

Account reactivation requires **manual unblocking by a Xoxzo engineer**.  
Please contact our support team (help@xoxzo.com) if this occurs.

---

### 3. Session Timeout Protocols
To further enhance security, stricter session management has been implemented.

- **Idle Timeout**  
  Users are automatically logged out after **30 minutes of inactivity**.

- **Absolute Timeout**  
  Users are required to re-authenticate after **24 hours**, regardless of activity level.

---

## Why We Are Making These Changes
As an API service provider, account security is critical to maintaining trust and reliability.

These updates are intended to:
- Prevent unauthorized access  
- Limit potential security risks  
- Enable users to detect unusual activity at an early stage

## Need Assistance?
If you have any questions regarding these changes,  
please feel free to contact our support team.

Xoxzo remains committed to providing a **secure and reliable API platform** for all users.
