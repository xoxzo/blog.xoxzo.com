I had a question and answer session over email with Mr. Ee, whose first job was as a software engineer, and is currently the Product Development Manager for a solution provider listed on the Singapore Exchange. He counts two decades of experience in software development and has vast experience in system architecture design, specializing in telecommunications solutions. In his current role, he is a team leader in charge of maintaining the company’s products.

**What factors made you stay in this industry for so long?**

**As a software grows in features over the years, will there be a need to re-write the software from scratch?**

> As long as the architecture is well designed, it shall fulfill the current as well as future demand, re-writing or re-designing is not necessary.

**I understand that you have years of experience working as a system architect. What are the most important considerations in system architecture design?**

> When designing a system, the goals should be:

> ·       Create a bug-free system

> ·       Create a high-performance system

> ·       Aim to have less overhead

> ·       Functionality design with structural and hierarchical considerations

**What are the challenges that developers in your team might face when doing their jobs?**

> Telco service providers have service level agreements to maintain, commonly at a system availability of 99% or more, so we aim to minimize system downtime at all cost. Developers need to have good technical skills on:

> ·       Telco service logic

> ·       Programming on live service environment

> ·       Service architecture and logic

**Are the developers in the industry fairly compensated in general?**

> The compensation is relatively fair.

**What do developers need to do to remain employable?**

> Developers should keep up with changes in technology advancement in IT, improve and update their skillsets with time.

**Working in a constantly challenging industry, how do you achieve work-life balance?**

> To relax from work, I do physical exercise, including yoga, and spend time with my family. Occasionally I also trek the jungle and climb mountains.

**How does mountain climbing or jungle trekking help you to take a break from work and recharge your energy?**

> Living in a fast-paced era, and a dense city full of skyscrapers, it can feel imprisoning. Nature is captivating and liberating for the body and the mind, it is like a magnet that draws me to the mountains. I had trekked to the summit of Gunung Ledang, and the Gunung Kinabalu base camp. When climbing a mountain, at times I was carrying the tent and equipment weighing 20kg, every step forward was a challenge, but it was impossible to stop or go backward, I could only continue to move forward, just like an epitome of life.
