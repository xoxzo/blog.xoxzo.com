Summary: The prefix for Toll-free numbers in Japan is *not 0120 only* You can use the prefix of *0800* for the same purpose. Collaborating with Xoxzo's API, you can transfer the received call to your convenient number, using Xoxzo's TTS (text-to-speech) function to answer the call with your favorite message, customise according to your needs and get the call-receipt data without hastle.


## About toll-free calling

_Toll-free calling_ refers to a service where a person can call a designated phone number and any cost for calling are to be paid by the recipient of the call.  It is often used to contact customer service or place orders or complaints; even if you have to wait a little to be connected, you know they’re the ones covering the calling costs so it’s not as irritating; nowadays just about everyone knows about this service.

But no doubt people have a sense that **toll free = a number that starts with 0120.** There are in fact toll-free numbers that **start with 0800.**  There’s even a fairly long history behind this; 11-digit toll-free numbers starting with 0800 came into existence in July of 1999.  It may look like a cell phone number since it starts with 080, but note that the fourth digit is a 0 (zero) so you can tell the difference that way.

In the United States, the same service where the recipient bears the burden of costs is called **toll-free calling** (as opposed to “free dial” in Japan), and these numbers may start with 1-800, 1-888, 1-877 etc.  Be sure to keep in mind that the Japanese term “free dial” is an English term used only in Japanese.


## The crisis of 0120 toll-free numbers

The reality is that **0120 numbers are currently facing a crisis.**  Numbers starting with 0120 are only followed by 6 digits, meaning only 1 million (10 to the power of 6) 0120 numbers can be given out.  Given this depletion and the premium placed on 0120 numbers, 0800 numbers were introduced as a backup but they still have not received widespread acknowledgement.

Despite the lack of recognition, 0800 numbers function exactly the same as 0120 numbers and have potential for the future.  It’s relatively easy to obtain 0800 numbers that are easy for customers to remember, such as a play on words or round numbers, and since they are 7 digits long, there are 10 million possible numbers that can be used.  There is practically no concern of experiencing **a shortage** like 0120 numbers are currently facing.

Companies currently using 0800 numbers, including some of the more well-known ones, when displaying their 0800 number, make it clear that they incur **no costs to the caller.**  Since not many people know that these are toll-free numbers, it is necessary to state this together with the phone number.   As more people start using 0800 numbers, the awareness that **0800 = toll-free calling** will no doubt gradually become more widespread.


## How to use a toll-free number once you have one

With a toll-free number it becomes possible to convey to your customers an attitude of openness, saying **"please feel free to contact us any time,”** but _how best to use a 0120 number or 0800 number_ once you have one?
