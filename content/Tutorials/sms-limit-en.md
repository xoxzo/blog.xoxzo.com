Summary: SMS is a great friend fo marketing as it has higher opening rates and simple and easy to send. A little concern is there is a limit in body text. Here we can introduce some tips to use SMS more convenient.


Using Xoxzo's [SMSAPI](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/sms-api/) and/or [EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/en/) and/or [DialSMS](https://help.xoxzo.com/en/ezsms-sms-delivery-service/articles/what-is-dialsms/), you can send SMS messages by not typing the recipients numbers nor body text on your phone but on your PC, you may send more number of people with ease too.

SMS is utilized in many scenes including business and marketing, as it is simple and easy to send and has higher opening rates than emails. For example:

+ Notification of Password confirmation on Online registration
+ Payment reminders to unpaid invoices
+ Next event notice to the past even visitors
+ Request for returning to the customers/patients who goes away from waiting room
+ Emergency notification on desaster without internet connection
+ Meeting minutes and changes reminder within the large organization
+ Corporate notifications and reminders

The list continues on.

But it is not easy to write the message text. Because SMS can include only up to 160 ASCII characters. It is unexpectedly difficult to summarize the well-noticeable contents within that limitation.

_First, whom you talk to_

__To XXX　（7 - 10 letters）__

_Introduction_

__Thank you for shopping at Xoxzo.（30 - 40 letters）__

_and the message_

__Please contact us for any questions you may have during the use.（70 - 80 characters）__

_Contact_

__Phone: 0123-456-789 (20 characters)__

_who you are_

__by Xoxzo sales dept (10 letters)__

This makes almost 160 characters, almost the limit.

It might be a fun to consider this as your summarize lesson, look up dictionaries and try to find a better wording. But it will be impossible to fit all in if you want to notify much more contents in your SMS. Taking the usage rate of smartphones of recent world, it will be better to fit all what you want to notify in a webpage, send the __URL link of the page__ in the SMS message.

Well though, the link URL is not as short and clear as `https://www.xoxzo.com/ja/` always, it can go over 160 characters sometimes.
