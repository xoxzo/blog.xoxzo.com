At the start of 2026, we would like to extend our sincere New Year’s greetings.

Following the business acquisition in 2024, Xoxzo Inc. marks its first full year of operation.
We owe this milestone entirely to the continued patronage and support of our valued customers and partners, and we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude.

For this year, we have set two guiding themes: “Completion” and “Beginning.”

“Completion” represents our commitment to refining our packaged services into fully integrated, comprehensive offerings, while steadily accomplishing the first phase of our business foundation.

“Beginning,” on the other hand, signifies the launch of our second phase—one focused on proactive business expansion and the creation of new services.

As a member of the KYUBIZ Group, we will continue to strengthen the foundation we have built so far, expand our potential even further, and work together as one team to make this a year of growth and advancement.

We remain dedicated to sincerely addressing our customers’ challenges and delivering services that earn lasting trust.
We kindly ask for your continued support and partnership throughout the coming year.
