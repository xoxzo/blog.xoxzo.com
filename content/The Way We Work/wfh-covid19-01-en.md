Summary: The Xoxzo team shows what kind of setup do they have working from home during the COVID19 crisis. Part 1.

# WFH Series: Episode 1, Part 1

The COVID19 pandemic crisis has affected millions of people worldwide.

All our team members in over 8 different cities around the world are experiencing
some sort of lockdown or restriction of movement orders which have affected how
we live and work.

In this series of posts which we call the **WFH Series** (Work From Home), we'll introduce to our
readers what the team in Xoxzo is doing to cope with the change in their
environment caused by the crisis. Our aim is to bring a different perspective
looking from the different cities and backgrounds our team members are from.

The posts in the series are meant to be short and light reads. We hope to
lighten up your day (and ours) and perhaps give some ideas to you on whatever you're
working on right now.

## Our Working Setup

Some of us have started beefing up our workstation setup at home. Here is a
sneak peak of how they look like:

### Kamal and Josef

[Josef](/author/josef-monje.html)'s (L) and [Kamal](/author/kamal-mustafa.html)'s (R) setups

Comment by Josef explaining his setup:
> I mainly use the MBA. But now since I'm also studying, I got my old Lenovo and transferred
> all work-related browsing and video conferencing to it to free up the MBA, this also allows to
> me keep an eye on things while doing school-related stuff. But for any dev work and travel
> (well nowadays, not anymore), I still use the MBA.

Comment by Kamal:
> The external monitor is my favorite setup now, using a multi-head so I can move some windows
> to the second monitor. I used to work everywhere - couch, bed, kitchen, etc, but now I mostly
> working from this desk.

### Geraldo and Iqbal

Geraldo's (L) and [Iqbal](/author/iqbal-abdullah.html)'s (R) setups

Comment by Geraldo explaining his setup:
> My idea for creating a working corner at home is to make something sellable.
> For example, if I'm looking for a coworking space or coffee shop to work outside I try aiming for
> the ones that offer a nice experience where all I need is my laptop. So I tried surrounding myself
> with nice objects like plants, nice coffee machine, and good lights. And yes, a proper
> comfortable chair that won't destroy my back. 

My comments on my setup:
> My work place at home is actually an installed cabinet in the wall which was taken out
> and its place is now a makeshift cubicle with a desk.
> I have not been using the 2nd monitor for the past 5 years as I usually work
> outside of home, but now I find it helpful to have a bigger monitor and more
> screens to see at the same time.

That's it from four of our team members. Continue reading [part 2]({filename}/The Way We Work/wfh-covid19-02-en.md)
