Summary: We did our annual Spring Team Camp in April this year, but it was done entirely online.

Every March all of us get together for around one week, for what we call the
Spring Team Camp. Last year [we all gathered in Okinawa for a few days]({filename}/The Way We Work/oka-team-camp-2019-en.md).

# Spring 2020 is here

For this year, we initially planned to have our camp in [Da Nang, Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Nang)
in March. Unfortunately, COVID19 broke out in February and now has affected movement and travel in
all the places where our team members are.

So we decided to have our Spring Team Camp(?) online instead.

We split the Camp into 2 days. One issue we have by having the camp online is
the timezone differences of each of our colleagues. We have a formal core time of four
hours each day (between 1 PM to 5 PM) where everyone overlaps, so the time
where we can have *"everyone present"* is limited.

## Day 1

The first day started off with presentations from teams for Evangelism, UI/UX, Customer
Success, and finally a discussion lead by engineering to decide the recipients of
our Annual Open Source grant.

### Evangelism

The Evangelism team lead by Geraldo went through the initiatives that we
carried out last year, and what kind of results we could see from them. A
particular note of interest is the increase in traffic especially to our
official blog and the blog posts which received many views are mostly posts which
**DO NOT** talk about our products.

All of our team members write on the blog, and it has shown that the time spent
writing and giving a peak to the outside world on how we think and do our work
is giving a positive effect in the context of promoting the company brand and
values.

### UI/UX

[Hyejeong](/author/hyejeong-park.html) came up next and walked us through the initiatives in user interface
and customer experience that she has been working on in the past year. We could
clearly see the progression in terms of UI which is backed by the changing ideas on
how we would like our customer experience to be.

UI/UX is and will become more important in our products going forward.

### Customer Success

[Aiko](/author/aiko-yokoyama.html) presented her year leading Customer Success. Aiko first went through
the statistics of the role, such as the amount of inquiries received, time taken to
respond, reviews received from customers and also a breakdown on what the
inquiries are about. Most important of all, Aiko reiterates to us the most
pressing issues that she thinks we should be working on to improve customer
satisfaction.

Aiko's role is one of the most crucial here in Xoxzo, where she is the point-person
talking to customers and potential customers on a daily basis. The insights that she
shares with us from her daily interactions are invaluable as we shape the direction
of our products.

We're currently using [Help Scout](https://www.helpscout.com/) by the way, and it has
nifty tools to help you pull statistics such as the amount of inquiries per channel and time taken to
resolve an issue.

### Annual Open Source grant

If you're not familiar with our Annual Open Source grant, you can read it up [here]({filename}/Community/annual-opensource-grant-2018-en.md).

As the last agenda for the second day, the engineering team lead by [Kamal](/author/kamal-mustafa.html)
discussed and decided on the projects which we will contribute to through our
Annual Open Source grant. You can read about the recipients of our grant for 2020 [here]({filename}/Community/annual-opensource-grant-2020-en.md).

## Day 2

We continued on the second day with our last two sessions.

### Engineering report and review

We're an engineering heavy company, and the annual engineering report and review
is an important event for us. Team lead [Zaki](/author/zaki-akhmad.html) presented a review of
what the engineering team has accomplished in the past year.

- There was a total of 44 releases for Xoxzo and 11 releases for EZSMS in the
  past year. Releases include bug fixes, small improvements and major
  functionality releases.

Major functionality releases were

- [Text To Speech supporting the Indonesian language](https://docs.xoxzo.com/en/utilsapi.html#text-to-speech-api-ref). 
  You can test our Text To Speech calls from our [demo page](https://hello.xoxzo.com/en/).
- [Receiving SMS API]({filename}/Announcements/2019-12-25-sin-release-en.md)
- [Logs download]({filename}/Announcements/logs-download-release-en.md)
- [Dashboard on points usage]({filename}/Announcements/2020-03-05-dashboard-release-en.md)
- [Mobile authentication as a security enhancement]({filename}/Announcements/2019-10-23-x4-authentication-en.md)

One release which we were especially happy of is our [notifications plugin for Woocommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/xoxzo-sms-voice-notification-for-woocommerce/).
This is a plugin that allows a Woocommerce site administrator to receive
notifications via voice calls or SMS if certain actions on orders happen.
It is also released as an [open-source project](https://github.com/xoxzo/wooxplugin)
if you're interested to learn more about the plugin

### 2019 and 2020: Review and the future

The last session was presented by myself and traditionally is the last session
in our team camps. We went through the financial results of the previous year,
business metrics and finally our targets for the next year and the vision for
the business and company.

These are not published publically, so if you want to know you'll need to [join

# Wrapping up

It was the first time in a few years that we could not get together to have our
annual team camp. Looking at how things are coming along with the pandemic, it
also seems that we will not be able to meet in person for at least the rest of the year.

In terms of the operational aspects of the team camp, it was much easier and
less stressful due to the fact that we do not have to travel. But of course,
the fun part of team camps is the travelling itself.

We'll see you again at our next team camp, hopefully in person somewhere on the planet!
