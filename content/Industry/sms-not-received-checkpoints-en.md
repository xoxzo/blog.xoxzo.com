## 📱 3 Checkpoints When an SMS Doesn't Arrive

SMS messages use a different communication channel from email and are usually received through the **Messages (SMS)** app.  
On both Android and iPhone, they do **not** appear in an email inbox.

Still, it’s quite common for users to say that an SMS message “didn’t arrive” or “can’t be found.”  
In many cases, the message **was delivered**, but couldn’t be located due to the recipient’s app settings or configuration differences.  
Below are the **three main points** to check when an SMS can’t be found.

### ① Check the “Messages (SMS)” App, Not the Email App

SMS messages are separate from email (e.g., Gmail).  
💬 Look for the **speech bubble icon**—that’s the “Messages” app used for SMS.  
✉️ Opening the **envelope icon** (email app) will not display SMS messages.

### ② Check the “＋Message (Plus Message)” App

If you’re using a device from Japanese Carriers **docomo, au, or SoftBank**,  
you may have the **＋Message (Plus Message)** app pre-installed.  
When this app is set as the default SMS handler,  
incoming SMS messages may appear there instead of the regular SMS folder.

If you see a **blue speech bubble icon** labeled “＋Message,” open it and check your inbox there.

### ③ Check for International SMS Blocking Settings

Some carriers block SMS messages received through **international routes**,  
which are sometimes used by global SMS services such as Xoxzo.  
On certain devices, this restriction is enabled by default.

**How to fix it:**

1. Open “Messages settings” or “Advanced settings” on your phone.  
2. Look for options such as “Block international SMS” or “Block unknown senders.”  
3. Temporarily disable those settings and try receiving the message again.

## 💬 If It Still Doesn’t Arrive

- When messages are sent via global SMS routes, temporary delays on the carrier’s system may occur.  
- In some cases, you can contact your carrier’s support and ask them to check the **delivery logs** for the SMS message.

## 🔊 Alternative Option: Voice Call Authentication

If SMS delivery is difficult—or if the user only has access to a **landline** instead of a mobile phone—  
**voice call text-to-speech authentication** can be used as an alternative.  

Adding this option broadens accessibility, improves convenience,  
and may even enhance the overall value of your service.

Xoxzo provides a **Voice API** that can automatically read out verification codes.  
Each call costs about **10 JPY**.  
For more information, see the [Xoxzo Voice API documentation](https://docs.xoxzo.com/en/voice/).
