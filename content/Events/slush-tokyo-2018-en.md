Summary: Xoxzo was at Slush Tokyo 2018, and talked to the top startups and investors.

Slush is a startup and tech event, organized annually in Helsinki, Tokyo,
Singapore and Shanghai. This year we applied for the Startup pass, and
particpated in the event.

The Startup pass allows us to access their matchmaking platform, which allows you
to reach out to other participants (startups, investors, corporate executives)
and arrange for a meeting. 

Our main purpose participating this year was to find startups and companies that
will be interested to work with us by utilizing our [Xoxzo Communications Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/)
to engage with and enchance the user experience of their products. We believe we
have a lot of value to offer to foreign startups trying to quickly expand to Japan,
with our easy of use UX, our focus in Japan and low cost to start.

We managed to secure appointments with some of the visiting startups, and
also managed to sit down and listen to some of the visiting investors on their
take of the startup scene in Japan. Perhaps I will sit down and write about that
in a different post.

Some of the interesting startups that I managed to talk to are

- [SENTBE](https://www.sentbe.com/en/) Peer-to-peer international remittance service,
  which skips the banks.
- XYLEM Networks Seemless peer-to-peer network resources
  sharing service, which rewards you when you share.
- [flamingo](https://app-flamingo.com/) A language teacher match-making service
- [Oyraa](https://www.oyraa.com/) An on demand interpretation service
- [HIDDEN TRACK](http://hiddentrack.co/) An event sharing service
- [Buyandship Hong Kong](http://www.buyandship.co.jp/) Shipping service to local
  address so you can avoid paying international shipment and buy locally limited
  items.

I find them full of energy and moving fast to secure partnerships and investors
to push their ideas to the next stage. Each business is unique in their own way
and I find them very interesting.

Personally, I like the energetic atmosphere of Slush: The young and energetic
volunteers did a great job and making Slush Tokyo a welcoming and hyper-charged
event.

Looking forward to another round of similar conferences of discussion and sharing . Until then, back to
work!
