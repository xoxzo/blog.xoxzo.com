Summary: In Feb 2017, Xoxzo is 10 years old. We got together in Langkawi to celebrate

In Feb 2017, Xoxzo celebrates it's 10th year. To celebrate, the whole team
except for Aiko and Arthur came to Langkawi and spent 3 days in the sun. For
last year, [we all gathered in Tokyo to work together]({filename}/The Way We Work/tokyo-team-camp-en.md).

The Andaman
-------------------------------------------------
We spent 2 nights at the The Andaman, a resort on the 
northern part of Langkawi Island. It is a quiet resort with it's own private beach. 
The resort has rules to preserve it's surrounding and no motor water sports can take 
place at it's beach.

It also works hard to conserve it's surroundings and allows the wild monkeys to
breed and play around on resort grounds.

Giving thanks
-------------------------------------------------
The team comprises of different people from different cities and nationalities, 
but every now and then we do get together to work and enjoy time together. During the 
dinner, we took sometime to reflect on the past and also to give 
thanks on the many blessings that we have.

Morning walk
-------------------------------------------------
The Andaman has guided morning walks that brings you around the resort with a
knowledgable guide that will talk you through the variety of flora and fauna
they have around the resort and near the beach. 

We requested one and our guide Elis showed us the resident tockay gecko nesting
on the roof, the mengkuang tree which has the largest leaf in the world, and
also the Sunda flying lemur.

Meeting Stampede
-------------------------------------------------

On our second day we met up with Shaza and Dov from Stampede
Design which is
based in Langkawi. Stampede Design is very similar to us in terms of team
building and how they look at their work. We discussed issues that we face when
working in a remote team, and how Stampede Design uses tools and pre-defined
communication text prompts to replace the missing body language in communication 
or physical company culture to install a feeling of comradery among team members.

I was especially interested in two topics that we discussed: One was concerning
[Simon Sinek's Golden
Circle](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)
on how we define our position and why we're all here. 

The other was about allowing each lead within their team to directly communicate with their
customers as opposed to communicate through a project manager. This creates a
sense of ownership, responsibility and positive effects on overall team morale.

It was a fruitful meeting. Originally scheduled for an hour, it ended up taking two hours
instead.

In Summary
-------------------------------------------------
It was a good 3 days spent, meeting with the team members and their families. We
also took time to discuss on our targets and where we want to head from now on.
After 10 years of surviving, we all at least deserved some days in the sun.

See you again [next year]({filename}/The Way We Work/cju-team-camp-2018-en.md)!
